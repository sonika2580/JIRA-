# JIRA Documentation

For this Healthcare Insurance Company project, the sprint was divided for two weeks as one sprint per week. The first week was related to understanding the requirements, collecting necessary information and creating documentation and lay out the structure of the project. The second week was mostly the implementation of the structure created and build ETL pipeline and validate the data. Last but not least was creating a Report/Presentation.

 Below are some of the screenshots taken from the JIRA software to showcase how the task were divided in each of the sprints.
